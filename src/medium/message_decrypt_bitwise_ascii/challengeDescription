Jungle Mystery Decoder

Create a function named decodeJungleMessage that receives message and key as its parameters.

This function decodes cryptic messages found in ancient ruins. Each message is an array of integers. Follow these steps to decode:

Select elements at indices that are multiples of the key.
Apply these operations to each selected element:
If even, perform a bitwise AND with the key.
If odd, perform a bitwise OR with the key.
If a multiple of 3, decrement by 1.
If a multiple of 5, increment by 1.
Convert each resulting integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
Concatenate the characters to form the decoded message string.
Parameters:

message (int[]): An array of integers representing the encoded message.
key (int): A number used in logical and arithmetic operations to decode the message.
The function returns the decoded message as a String.
