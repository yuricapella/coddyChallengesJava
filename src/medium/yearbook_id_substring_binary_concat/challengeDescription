Yearbook ID Generator


Create a function named generateYearbookId that receives name and graduationYear as its parameters.

This function aims to generate a unique ID for each student's yearbook entry based on their name and graduation year.

The ID should be generated using the following rules:

Take the first three characters of the student's name. If the name is less than three characters, use the entire name.
Convert the last two digits of the graduation year to binary.
Concatenate the truncated name, the string "20", the binary representation of
the last two digits of the graduation year, and the length of the student's full name.
For example, if the input is "John Smith" and 2024, the steps would be:

Truncate the name to "Joh".
Convert 24 (last two digits of graduation year) to binary: 11000.
Concatenate "Joh", "20", "11000", and 10 (length of "John Smith"), resulting in "Joh201100010".
Parameters:

name (String): The name of the student. It will only contain alphabetic characters (A-Z or a-z) and spaces.
graduationYear (int): The graduation year of the student. It will be a valid year format (e.g., 2024).
The function returns a String representing the unique yearbook ID for the student.
