Seed Sequencer

Create a function named seedSequencer that receives seedList and base as its parameters.

This function generates a unique seed sequence based on the provided list of seed names and a specified number base.

Steps:

Convert each seed name in seedList to its ASCII representation.
Concatenate the ASCII values of all seed names into a single list.
Convert the concatenated ASCII values into the specified number base (base).
Create a string representation of the converted value.
Parameters:

seedList (String[]): An array of seed names.
base (int): The desired number base for encoding (e.g., 2 for binary, 10 for decimal).
The function returns the generated seed sequence as a string.
