Lucky Year Checker

Create a function named isLuckyYear that receives birthYear and luckyNumber as parameters.

This function determines if a birth year is a "lucky year" based on the lucky number. A year is lucky if it is divisible by the lucky number.

To solve this:

Check if birthYear is divisible by luckyNumber using the modulo operator (%).
If the remainder is 0, return: "{birthYear} is a lucky year!".
If the remainder is not 0, return: "{birthYear} is not a lucky year.".
Replace {birthYear} in the return strings with the actual value of the birthYear parameter.

Parameters:

birthYear (int): The birth year of the person.
luckyNumber (int): The personâ€™s lucky number, a positive integer greater than 0.
The function returns a String: either "{birthYear} is a lucky year!" or "{birthYear} is not a lucky year.".
