Treasure Hunt Map Decoder

Create a function named findTreasure that receives map and start as its parameters.

This function aims to find the location of a hidden treasure by deciphering a series of coded instructions represented by an array of integers.

The map array contains a series of integers, where each element represents the index of the next position to move to. The start parameter indicates the starting index in the map array.

To find the treasure, follow these steps:

Begin at the index specified by start in the map array.
Follow the instruction at the current index, which leads to the next index to move to.
Continue following the instructions until one of the following conditions is met:
The next index is out of bounds (i.e., it exceeds the size of the map array).
The next index has already been visited, indicating a loop in the instructions.
If the next index is out of bounds, return -1 to indicate an error.
If a loop is detected, return the index where the loop starts, as it represents the location of the treasure.
Parameters:

map (int[]): An array of integers representing the coded instructions to reach the treasure. Each element in the array indicates the index of the next position to move to.
start (int): An integer representing the starting index in the map array.
The function returns an integer representing the index where the treasure is located. If the instructions lead to an index out of bounds, the function returns -1 to indicate an error.
