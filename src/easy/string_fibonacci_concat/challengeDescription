Botanical Garden Messages

Create a function named botanicalMessage that receives plantName and index as its parameters.

This function aims to generate a unique message for an informational sign in a botanical garden
by combining the plant name with a corresponding Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

Your task is to find the Fibonacci number at the specified index
(considering 0-based indexing) and concatenate it with the plantName to create the botanical message.

For example:

If plantName is "Rose" and index is 3,
the corresponding Fibonacci number would be 2 (considering 0-based indexing), so the function should return "Rose2".
If plantName is "Tulip" and index is 6, the corresponding Fibonacci number would be 8,
so the function should return "Tulip8".
Implement the logic to calculate the Fibonacci number at the given index
and concatenate it with the plant name to form the final message.

Parameters:
plantName (String): The name of the plant.
index (int): The index of the desired Fibonacci number (0-based).
The function returns a String representing the generated botanical message.
