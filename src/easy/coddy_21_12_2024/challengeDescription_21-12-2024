Fireplace Fuel Finder

Create a function named findFirstFittingLog that receives fireplaceSize and logBasket as parameters.

This function finds the index of the first log in the basket that fits into the fireplace opening.

Given the size of the fireplace opening and an array of log sizes, the function should iterate through the logBasket array and find the index of the first log that is less than or equal to the fireplaceSize. Use the break statement to exit the loop as soon as a fitting log is found.

If no log fits, the function should return -1.

Parameters:

fireplaceSize (int): The size of the fireplace opening.
logBasket (int[]): An array of log sizes.
The function returns an integer representing the index of the first fitting log, or -1 if none fit.the alphabetically sorted version of the input array.
