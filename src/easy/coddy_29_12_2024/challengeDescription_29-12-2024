Circular Object Count Manager


Challenge

Easy
Create a function named countCircularObjects that receives action, objectType, and count as parameters.

This function manages counts of circular objects (balls, coins, lenses) in a photography exhibit. It starts with zero counts for all objects. Based on the action ('add' or 'remove') and objectType, it updates the count. If 'remove' is requested and there are not enough objects, it returns an error message. The function returns a message indicating the current counts of all objects after the operation.

Parameters:

action (String): 'add' or 'remove'.
objectType (String): 'ball', 'coin', or 'lens'.
count (int): Number of items to add or remove.
The function returns a String message indicating the current counts of all objects after each operation.

Constraints:

action will be 'add' or 'remove'.
objectType will be 'ball', 'coin', or 'lens'.
count will be a positive integer.

Arguments to add

ball
5

Expected Output
Current counts: balls = 5, coins = 0, lenses = 0

Arguments to remove

ball
3

Expected Output
Error: Not enough balls to remove.
