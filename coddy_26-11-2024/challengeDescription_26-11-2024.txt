Mineral Essence Calculator

Create a function named calculateMineralEssence that receives mineralBinary and addScrub as its parameters.

This function aims to calculate the essence value of a mineral based on its binary representation and the optional addition of a beechnut scrub.

To determine the mineral's essence value:

Convert the mineralBinary string from binary to its decimal equivalent.
If addScrub is true, increase the decimal value by 1 to account for the added essence of the beechnut scrub.
The function should return the final calculated essence value as an integer.

Parameters:

mineralBinary (String): A string representing the binary number of the mineral. It should only contain '0' and '1' characters.
addScrub (boolean): Indicates whether to include the beechnut scrub, thereby increasing the essence value by 1.
The function returns an integer representing the calculated essence value of the mineral.
