Decipher the Ancient Message

Create a function named decipherAncientMessage that receives message as its parameter.

This function aims to decipher an ancient message found in a mysterious ruin and determine if it is a warning, a welcome message, or unknown.

You are an adventurer exploring an ancient ruin. Inside, you discover various messages inscribed on the walls. Each message can be categorized as either a "warning", a "welcome" message, or "unknown" if its meaning is unclear. Your task is to decipher these messages based on their content.

To categorize the messages, use the following criteria:

If the message contains the word "danger" or "beware" (case-insensitive), categorize it as a "warning".
If the message contains the word "welcome", "hello", or "greetings" (case-insensitive), categorize it as a "welcome" message.
If the message does not contain any of the keywords mentioned above, categorize it as "unknown".
Implement the logic to analyze the message based on these criteria and return the appropriate category.

Parameter:

message (String): The ancient message found in the ruin, which needs to be deciphered and categorized.
The function returns a String representing the category of the message, which can be "warning", "welcome", or "unknown".
