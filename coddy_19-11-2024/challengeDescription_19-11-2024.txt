Faery Festival Message Decoder

Create a function named fairyMessage that receives decimalNumber as its parameter.

This function aims to convert a decimal number to its binary representation, reverse the binary string, and return the reversed binary as a string.

In the enchanting world of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the fairies of the Summerlands communicate using a unique language where they reverse the binary representation of decimal numbers. As the faery festival approaches, the fairies wish to share a special message with the human world by encoding it in their language.

To decode the fairies' message:

Convert the given decimalNumber to its binary representation.
Reverse the binary string.
Return the reversed binary string.
For example, if the input decimalNumber is 5, the binary representation is "101". Reversing this binary string results in "101", which should be returned by the function.

Parameter:

decimalNumber (int): The decimal number to be converted and reversed.
The function returns a string representing the reversed binary representation of the input decimal number.
